We choose high performance computing cluster for scientific calculation due to following reasons:
* It can free your personal computers from heavy computing tasks. With a cluster, you can run complex programs on it and in the meanwhile you can do other works on your own PC. You can even shut down your PC without affecting the progress of programs on the cluster.
* It has great advantages in parallel computing. The clustersâ€™ processor is characterized by a large number of cores. Although the computing power of each core is not the strongest, it will provide a high speed-up when working together.
* It can deepen your understanding of software running environment and thus make you aware of writing more portable programs.
