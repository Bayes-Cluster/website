We provide programming and configuration support for High Performance Computing software. Our services include:

* Software installation (Licensed or Open-source)
* Troubleshooting malfunctioning programs
* Developing new parallel codes
* Parallelizing existing serial codes

We support several implementations of MPI, OpenMP and MATLAB Parallelization.
